1. Install Apache Hive in your Apache Hadoop container
2. Download the lego-database dataset and import it into Hive
3. Write a query that will display the name of the set (sets.name) with the largest number of parts (sets.num_parts)
4. Compose a query that will display in which year (sets.year) the most sets were released
5. Write a query that will display the total number of parts (inventory_parts.quantity) for each of the colors (colors.name)
6. * Modify the Dockerfile so that Hive is installed and launched with Hadoop
